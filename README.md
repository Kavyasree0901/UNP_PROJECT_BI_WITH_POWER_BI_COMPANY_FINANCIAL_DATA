# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIAL_DATA

I analyzed a company's financial dataset using Power BI as part of a value-added course with UNP Education. My work uncovered key insights into sales performance, profit trends, regional profitability, discount effects, and product performance. The findings reveal a 249.46% profit growth, variations in profit margins across different regions, and the impact of high and low-margin products. Based on these insights, I provided strategic recommendations to optimize pricing, discount strategies, inventory management, and sales expansion to drive sustainable business growth.
