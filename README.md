# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIAL_DATA

As part of our Value-Added Course with UNP Education, we conducted a Power BI-driven financial data analysis to explore key business metrics and gain actionable insights. This analysis focused on understanding sales performance, profit trends, regional profitability, the impact of discounts, and product performance. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s data visualization and analytical capabilities, we identified critical patterns and provided strategic recommendations to optimize business operations.

**Key Insights & Findings:**

Identified a 249.46% profit growth, driven by increased sales, pricing adjustments, and demand shifts.

Discovered regional profit margin variations, emphasizing the need for region-specific strategies to maximize profitability.

Analyzed discounting effects, revealing that excessive discounts on certain products led to profit erosion despite boosting sales.

Evaluated high and low-margin products, showing that while some low-margin products had strong sales, they negatively impacted overall profitability, whereas high-margin products contributed significantly to business growth.

**Strategic Recommendations:**

Refine pricing strategies through dynamic and value-based pricing.

Implement a structured discounting model to balance sales growth and profit margins.

Enhance inventory management using demand forecasting to minimize overstocking and stockouts.

Expand sales efforts in high-growth regions to capitalize on market opportunities.

This project highlighted the power of data-driven decision-making using Power BI, offering insights that can drive sustainable financial and operational improvements.
